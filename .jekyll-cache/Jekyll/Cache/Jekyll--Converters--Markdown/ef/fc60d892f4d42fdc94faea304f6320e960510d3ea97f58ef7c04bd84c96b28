<p>Welcome to RPG Jekyll, a Jekyll template aimed at roleplaying campaign session prep and world building.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Jekyll template is to provide a basic scafold and layout so you can start writting your next roleplaying campaign using the simple and fast <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown</a> syntax while providing a simple, visual and extensible tool that generates a wiki-like webpage that can be used in any device over the internet.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s primarely aimed to be used as a reference and world building tool for the DM, but it has built-in funcionality to create two different outputs, one with public articles only (for players) and another one including <em>DM Only</em> articles too (for the DM).</p>

<h1 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h1>

<p>First, write your campaign summary and intro in this very article (located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./index.md</code>) as a welcome page for your campaign. After that, there are six main categories for you to start creating your campaign:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code>, where you plan out sessions. They are at the bottom of your welcome page.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_characters</code>, where you define the living entities that populate your world.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_items</code> contains all the relevant objects your players will find.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_locations</code> describes all the places that can be visited.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_rules</code> is the place for your house rules or brief summary rules.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_stories</code> contains all the lore, events, quests and narrative bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of those sections you can find example files on how to write new content and feed the necessary metadata.</p>
