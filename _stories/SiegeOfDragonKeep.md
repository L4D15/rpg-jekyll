You can use a story entry to expand on your world's lore, or describe a quest players can take at some point.

# Section 1

If you insert a top-level heading, a table of content will be generated and displayed at the side. Useful if your document grows larger.

## Section 1.1

You can also include tables, useful for random encounters.

| Roll d20 | Event |
|:--------:|:------|
| 1-5       | Nothing happens |
| 6-10      | Goblins x4    |
| 11-15     | Kobolds x6    |
| 16-20     | Ancient Red Dragon |

### Linking

You can create links to other content using the regular markdown syntax and providing a relative URL. For example, [Kiki](/characters/kiki), [Shadow Dale](/locations/shadowdale) or [Deck of Many Things](/deckofmanythings).

>Beware of URLs. If you don't specify a permaling for an article, its URL will be its relative project path without the starting `_`. If an article has a custom permaling set in its front matter, like the Deck of Many Things does, you will need to use that as the URL.
