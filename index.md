# Introduction

Welcome to RPG Jekyll, a Jekyll template aimed at roleplaying campaign management and world builing. The porpuse of this Jekyll template is to provide a basic scafold and layout so you can start writting your next roleplaying campaign using the simple and fast [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax while providing a visual and usable final result that can be used in any device over the internet.

# How to use it

There are five main categories for you to start creating your campaign:

* [Characters](characters), where you define the living entities that populate your world.
* [Items](items) contains all the relevant objects your players can interact with.
* [Locations](locations) describers all the places that can be visited.
* [Rules](rules) summary of the game rules and special home rules.
* [Stories](stories) the narrative, main and secondary missions of your game.

In each of those sections you can find example files on how to write new content and feed the necessary metadata.

## Images

To add images you can use their URL or save them into the `/assets/img` folder and reference them using a relative path.
