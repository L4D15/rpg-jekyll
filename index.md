# Introduction

Welcome to RPG Jekyll, a Jekyll template aimed at roleplaying campaign session prep and world building.

The purpose of this Jekyll template is to provide a basic scafold and layout so you can start writting your next roleplaying campaign using the simple and fast [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax while providing a simple, visual and extensible tool that generates a wiki-like webpage that can be used in any device over the internet.

It's primarely aimed to be used as a reference and world building tool for the DM, but it has built-in funcionality to create two different outputs, one with public articles only (for players) and another one including *DM Only* articles too (for the DM).

# How to use it

First, write your campaign summary and intro in this very article (located at `./index.md`) as a welcome page for your campaign. After that, there are six main categories for you to start creating your campaign:

* `_posts`, where you plan out sessions. They are at the bottom of your welcome page.
* `_characters`, where you define the living entities that populate your world.
* `_items` contains all the relevant objects your players will find.
* `_locations` describes all the places that can be visited.
* `_rules` is the place for your house rules or brief summary rules.
* `_stories` contains all the lore, events, quests and narrative bits.

In each of those sections you can find example files on how to write new content and feed the necessary metadata.
